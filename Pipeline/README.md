## LiDAR-based Calculation Pipeline.ipynb

End-to-end LiDAR pipeline that processes a batch of timestamps in a single run. Stage 1 applies two ground filters in parallel on the same MCAP frame per timestamp — Patchwork++ and CSF — and saves the resulting ground-only point clouds as `.bin` files. Stage 2 reads each `.bin` file and computes slope and curvature using four methods: PCA, RANSAC, height-derivative, and IRLS quadric. Each method × filter combination produces one `.npz` result file, giving up to eight files per timestamp. The bag index is built once and reused across all timestamps in the batch.

**Input** \
An `.mcap` recording with LiDAR `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` topics and `/tf_static` for sensor calibration

**Adjustable parameters** \
`MCAP_PATH` — path to the `.mcap` recording \
`TIMESTAMPS` — list of Unix timestamps to process (generate these with `Random Frame Generator.ipynb`) \
`GROUND_BIN_DIR` — folder where ground-only `.bin` files are saved \
`RESULTS_DIR` — base folder for curvature `.npz` output \
`LIDAR_TOPICS` — list of ROS topic names to load and merge \
`PW_SENSOR_HEIGHT` / `PW_MIN_RANGE` / `PW_MAX_RANGE` — Patchwork++ ground plane fitting parameters \
`CSF_CLOTH_RESOLUTION` / `CSF_SLOPE_SMOOTH` / `CSF_THRESHOLD` / `CSF_X_RANGE` / `CSF_Y_RANGE` — CSF parameters \
`SENSOR_TRANSFORMS` — per-topic translation and RPY rotation for sensor-to-base_link calibration (used by CSF) \
`ROI_X_RANGE` / `ROI_Y_RANGE` — forward strip for Stage 2 curvature calculation \
`PROFILE_BIN_SIZE` / `PROFILE_MIN_PTS` / `PROFILE_MEDIAN_WINDOW` / `PROFILE_SMOOTH_WINDOW` — binning and smoothing \
`RANSAC_N_ITER` / `RANSAC_DIST_THRESH` — RANSAC parameters \
`IRLS_MAX_ITER` / `IRLS_C_TUKEY` — IRLS quadric parameters

**Output** \
Per timestamp, two ground-only `.bin` files in `GROUND_BIN_DIR`: \
`<stem>_patchwork.bin` — Patchwork++ ground points (nuScenes format) \
`<stem>_csf.bin` — CSF ground points (nuScenes format) \
Up to eight `.npz` files per timestamp in `RESULTS_DIR/<date>/<time>/<timestamp>/`: \
`PCA_patchwork_<ms>.npz`, `RANSAC_patchwork_<ms>.npz`, `height-deriv_patchwork_<ms>.npz`, `IRLS_patchwork_<ms>.npz` and the four `_csf` equivalents

## Non-LiDAR-based Calculation Pipeline.py

This script orchestrates the three non-LiDAR validation methods: AHN5, IMU/GPS (EKF), and KISS-ICP. It imports each module lazily and calls its `run()` function with a shared configuration block. Modules can be toggled on or off via the `REGISTRY` dict or overridden at runtime with command-line flags. A summary is printed at the end listing which modules succeeded or failed.

**Input** \
`MAIN_MCAP` — path to the main `.mcap` recording (used by AHN5 and KISS-ICP) \
`IMU_INPUT` — ZED `.svo2` or `.mcap` file for the IMU/GPS (EKF) method

**Adjustable parameters** \
`TIME` — reference Unix timestamp (must be the same value across all three methods) \
`OUTPUT_PATH` — base folder for all `.npz` output files \
`GPS_TOPIC` — GPS ROS topic name \
`PLOT` — set to `True` to show plots (each window must be closed before the next module starts) \
`REGISTRY` — dict mapping module names to `(enabled, module_name, config_lambda)`; set `enabled = False` to skip a module \
`--only NAME [NAME ...]` — run only the named modules and skip all others \
`--skip NAME [NAME ...]` — run all enabled modules except the named ones \
`--list` — print the available module names and exit

**Output** \
Delegated to the individual validation scripts (AHN5, EKF, KISS ICP); each saves `.npz` files to `OUTPUT_PATH/<date>/<time>/<int(TIME)>/`

## Validation_main.py

This script loads `.npz` result files from validation methods (physical measurements, AHN5, EKF, KISS-ICP) and LiDAR calculation methods (PCA, RANSAC, height-derivative, IRLS) and compares them quantitatively. All profiles are interpolated to a common distance grid, optionally fine-aligned to the physical reference using a sliding-window search, and trimmed to the evaluation window before comparison. RMSE and MAE are computed for both elevation and curvature for every validation × calculation pair. Results are exported to CSV and visualised as overlaid elevation and curvature plots.

**Input** \
`.npz` files in `VALIDATION_DIR` whose filenames start with one of the entries in `VALIDATION_PREFIXES` \
`.npz` files in `CALCULATION_DIR` whose filenames start with one of the entries in `CALCULATION_PREFIXES`

**Adjustable parameters** \
`VALIDATION_DIR` / `CALCULATION_DIR` — folders containing the `.npz` result files \
`VALIDATION_PREFIXES` — list of filename prefixes for validation-method `.npz` files (e.g. `["Physical_meas_"]`) \
`CALCULATION_PREFIXES` — list of filename prefixes for calculation-method `.npz` files (e.g. `["PCA_", "RANSAC_"]`) \
`THRESHOLD` — height difference for the "fraction within threshold" metric (default: `0.1` m) \
`SMOOTHENING_FACTOR` — spline smoothing applied to all profiles before comparison (default: `0` = no smoothing) \
`START_VALIDATION` — distance in metres where the physical measurement begins to rise (profile alignment anchor) \
`WINDOW_BACK_M` / `WINDOW_FWD_M` — evaluation window size in metres around `START_VALIDATION` \
`ALIGN_TO_REFERENCE` — align all profiles to the physical measurement reference before computing metrics \
`FINE_ALIGN` — enable per-method fine alignment using a sliding-window search \
`FINE_ALIGN_SEARCH_M` / `FINE_ALIGN_STEP_M` — search range and step size for fine alignment

**Output** \
A `.csv` file at `C:\Users\karel\OneDrive\BEP\<timestamp>.csv` with RMSE, MAE, and fraction-in-threshold for every method pair \
Plots: elevation profile overlay, curvature profile overlay (log scale), elevation difference plot

## Random Frame Generator.ipynb

This utility notebook generates a list of random Unix timestamps distributed uniformly within the first five minutes of a recording. The date and time are parsed automatically from the recording's file path. The output is a ready-to-paste Python list called `TIMESTAMPS` for use in `LiDAR-based Calculation Pipeline.ipynb`.

**Adjustable parameters** \
`file_path` — path to a `.mcap` recording; the date and time are extracted from the path structure `<date>/Rosbag/<time>/rosbag/rosbag_0.mcap` \
`aantal_timestamps` — number of random timestamps to generate

**Output** \
A sorted Python list of Unix timestamp floats printed to the notebook output, ready to paste into the pipeline notebook
